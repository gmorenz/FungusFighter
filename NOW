NOW:

[x] non-symmmetric hurtboxes
[ ] hurtboxes: clamp to y-ranges of sprite
[ ] loading files depending on debug config or not

[ ] understand fps / syncing logic (maybe check GGRS docs ?)
[x] include new goose anims (walking, etc)
[-] try out new port (80) and see if I (Kevan) can connect to Greg
