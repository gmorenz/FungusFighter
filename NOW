NOW:

[x] non-symmmetric hurtboxes
[x] hurtboxes: clamp to y-ranges of sprite
[x] walk backwards (quick hack)

[ ] impl basic "endurance"/stamina system
    - tick down slowly when you're moving backwards
    - tick down a chunk (1/4 of health, say) when you get hit.

[ ] basic jumps
    - press a key (which?) to jump (set velocity to be upwards)
    - apply gravity while in the air

[ ] loading files depending on debug config or not
    (Greg will look into this offline)

[ ] understand fps / syncing logic (maybe check GGRS docs ?)
    (nice to have)

[x] include new goose anims (walking, etc)
[-] try out new port (80) and see if I (Kevan) can connect to Greg
    (Greg wants to figure this out offline)
