Walking backwards, reverse sprite order.

game design features brainstorming
- blocking
    hold back to block, or (like street fighter)
        > has a cost (giving up space)
    hold a button (like ssb)
- jumping (or maybe dashing)
    useful if you're cornered
        (actions available when jumping = ?)
        (would be nice to be somewhat vulnerable / punishable)
- player collisions
    ? (something less janky than just walking into each other,
        and continuing the walking anim?)
    (or could just ignore entirely)
- health ...?
    > Lily proposed the mechanic of "stamina" (or energy or w/e)
    > that is consumed by attacks (and other moves).
    > Getting hit by an attack reduces stamina by a lot, and
    > stamina also decreases on its own gradually.
    > This can be used to balance very powerful moves, and
    > it also encourages aggressive gameplay. Aggressive moves
    > would be made to consume more stamina than defensive ones.
- crouching
    > needs higher hitboxes (as does jumping)
- wall jumping ??!
    > ceiling-based follow-up attack

game implementation features:
- number of lives (represented differently than a gauge?)

dev feature:
- record/replay games for testing

NOW:

[x] new goose anims: block, "ouch"
    [x] add them
    [x] remove the first frame of each

[ ] impl basic "endurance"/stamina system
    - tick down slowly when you're moving backwards
    - tick down a chunk (1/4 of health, say) when you get hit.

[ ] basic jumps
    - press a key (which?) to jump (set velocity to be upwards)
    - apply gravity while in the air

[ ] loading files depending on debug config or not
    (Greg will look into this offline)

[ ] understand fps / syncing logic (maybe check GGRS docs ?)
    (nice to have)
