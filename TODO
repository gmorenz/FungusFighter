game design features brainstorming
- blocking
    hold back to block, or (like street fighter)
        > has a cost (giving up space)
    hold a button (like ssb)
- jumping (or maybe dashing)
    useful if you're cornered
        (actions available when jumping = ?)
        (would be nice to be somewhat vulnerable / punishable)
- player collisions
    ? (something less janky than just walking into each other,
        and continuing the walking anim?)
    (or could just ignore entirely)
- health =?
- crouching
    > needs higher hitboxes (as does jumping)
- wall jumping ??!
    > ceiling-based follow-up attack

game implementation features:
- walking animation
- number of lives (represented differently than a gauge?)

(TODO for later: play an old street fighter for "research")
